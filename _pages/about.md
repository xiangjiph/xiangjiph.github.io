I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Biological Physics in [Professor David Kleinfeld](https://physics.ucsd.edu/Directory/Person/90)'s research group at UC San Diego (UCSD). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCSD. I am combining experimental, theoretical and computational approaches to understand brain vascular network strucutre and its roles in maintaining homeostasis and regulating blood flow. Specifically, I am working on the following directions: 
- Developing techniques for large-scale, high-resoluiton 3D imaging of heterogeneous biological tissue 
- Developing computational pipelines to construct the spatial graph representation (vascular connectome) of the entire vasuclar network in mouse brain 
- Applying theoretical analysis and computational modeling to quantitatively understand the physiological significances of the network structure 

 
<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
